No, git will keep tracking it. Because it has already been added to the git index.

To stop tracking a file you need to remove it from the index. This can be achieved with this command.

git rm --cached <file>
If you want to remove a whole folder, you need to remove all files in it recursively.

git rm -r --cached <folder>
